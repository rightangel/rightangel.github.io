# CYCLADES TRAVELLING SAILOR

*a game by rightangel*
*Created for Ludum Dare 39 (Theme: Running out of Power) July 2017*

It's a simple game: your ship must collect all yellow balls in the sea and then reach the lighthouse.
Click on the yellow balls to collect them and then on the lighthouse to complete the level.
You have enough power to cover the distance needed, but not more! Try not to run out of power.
